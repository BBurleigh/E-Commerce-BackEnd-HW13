# E-Commerce-BackEnd-HW13

## Description 
---
Aside from being the thirteenth homework assignment, we are continuing to practice our back-end skills by creating a database, seeding, and then testing our databases with Insomnia get, post, put, and delete commands. 

## Installation
---
The following commands will need to be run in the user's terminal, with the exception of the last one, which is a program:

1) mysql --> create database

2) run npm seed --> seed database

3) Insomnia --> test get, post, put, and delete

## Demo Video
---
A demonstration video of the app's functionality is provided below.

## Usage 
---
In theory, a manager could use this code, in combination with Insomnia, to add categories, tags, and products to their inventory, change/update information, and delete old information.

## Credits
---
Aside from my instructor and T.A., my tutor as well as a few people at AskBCS assisted me in better understanding the creation of the models and adjusting the routes.
